I'm trying out this whole Jekyll/Octopress thing to start a blog. I want to become more familiar with all of the possible hacker-y ways to get better and more comfortable with coding. This blog will be a meta-exploration of me figuring out new ways to write this blog in the best way possible to expand my learning and knowledge.

And boy, have I already done some things I never even thought possible.
